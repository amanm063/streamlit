I am starting to learn streamlit 

here is the course I am learning from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiA4fRfLuCk&list=PLa6CNrvKM5QU7AjAS90zCMIwi9RTFNIIW&index=3

also I am using linuxmint for this project.
In case the course is too old please refer to a new one.
refer to this link for markdown fx -https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/

for using maths we have to use latex functions
please refer to this url for latex functions https://katex.org/docs/supported.html

instead of using pip i am trying uv
just paste this in the terminal 
    pip install uv
why uv?
according to a streamlit doc uv is 10 times faster than pip in installing any lib
just use uv pip install instead of pip install.
It is open source also.
